    "    - neither implies the other. CIP is a no-arbitrage relationship of forward rates vs spot rates. UIP is a hypothesis that FX risk does not earn a premium; in other words, expected excess returns of FX are zero. The theory does not imply the no-arbitrage relationship, nor vice-versa. It is true that sometimes we use the CIP relationship to insert into UIP to write it in a different form, but this is not enough to prove UIP; it is simply restating it in terms of forward rates.\n",

Namely, being long options is being long vol. So, we are long a lot more put options than call options, meaning that in a vacuum, we are long vol. However, this depends on the strikes of the options. So if the call-like factor is closer to ATM than the put-like factor, then we might actually be short vol, since the calls will have a higher vega than the puts. However, if the strikes are symmetric (equally OTM), then we are long vol.\n",
