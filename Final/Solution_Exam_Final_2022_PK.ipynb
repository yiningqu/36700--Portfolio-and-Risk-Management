    "Consider our momentum construction of going long the biggest winners and short the biggest losers.<br><br>\n",
    "What is the tradeoff of focusing the long and short positions narrowly, (a single decile top and bottom) versus more broadly, (three deciles top and bottom)?\n",
    "<br><br>Did our empirical investigation support this theoretical tradeoff?\n",
    "</b><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> **Solution:**  Creating Momentum with a single top and bottom decile, leads to higher mean returns as we the construction concentrates the winners and losers, but also icreased idiosyncratic risk. However, a wider construction with 3 top and bottom deciles reduces the idiosyncratic risk as we have a broader range of securities and thus a more diversified portfolio.<br><br></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> From our investigation in HW-6, this is exactly what we saw in the data: narrower construction had higher mean and higher volatility. <br><br></span>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. <b>(5 pts) We investigated LTCM's market exposure and found it is nonlinear. Explain this nonlinearity:\n",
    "does it imply LTCM has high upside, large downside, both, etc?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> **Solution:** We ran two regressions to analyze LTCM's exposure to market:</span><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center> <span style=\"color:#00008B\">$\\tilde{r}^{LTCM} = \\alpha + \\beta_{1}\\tilde{r}^{m}_{t} + \\beta_{2}(\\tilde{r}^{m}_{t})^{2} +\\epsilon_t$ </span></center> <br>\n",

    "<center><span style=\"color:#00008B\"> $\\tilde{r}^{LTCM} = \\alpha + \\beta\\tilde{r}^{m}_{t} + \\beta_{u}max(\\tilde{r}^{m}_{t} - k_{1},0) + \\beta_{d}max(k_{2} - \\tilde{r}^{m}_{t},0) +\\epsilon_t$</span></center> \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\">and found that the beta to  $\\text{SPY}^{2}$  returns is negative, LTCM's market exposure behaves as if it were short the market options. Similarly from the $2^{nd}$ regression we found the betas's indicating that LTCM seem to be short the call-like factor and long the put-like factor.</span> <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\">Focussing on the second (option-like) regression, it indicates LTCM overperforms down markets and underperforms up markets. So limited upside and limited downside</span> <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\">Based on the beta's of the nonlinear components in the regressions, we found that LTCM had a huge downside as they were shorting the volatility in the market. The negative exposure to $\\text{SPY}^{2}$ indicates LTCM underperforms particularly large SPY movements (whether on the upside or downside).However, given the low $R^{2}$ of this quadratic regression, we cannot too much emphasis on the results.</span> <br><br>\n",

    "<b>State one approach we discussed regarding how to improve the stability of our optimized portfolio.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> **Solution:**  Small changes in mean returns of underlying assets have large impact on the weights of the mean-variance optimized portfolio. The tangency portfolio weights are sensitive to changes in mean return due to the nature of the inverted covariance matrix.</span><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> We discussed using Ridge and LASSO would address the extereme weights produced by the mean-variance optimization by penalizing the objective function, (equivalently by regularizing the covariance matrix, which improves the stability of its inverse.). Generally, regularizing/diagonalizing the covariance matrix would stabalize its inversion.</span><br>\n",

    "- <b> What would be the regression sample sizes for the CS regression? How many CS regressions would you estimate?</b><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> **Solution:** For the TS test, we would need to run 40 regressions. Each regression would use 22 year monthly excess returns of one of the 40 assets as our dependent variable and returns of the factor portfolios as the independent variables. Thus there will be a total sample size of 22*12 = 264 records.</span> <br><br>\n",

    "    \n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> **Solution:** GMO is a \"value\" investor in the sense of looking for low prices per fundamentals. This inherently places them in a position of going against what is hot in the market.</span> <br><br> \n",
    "    \n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> GMO opinionated that prices could deviate from fundamental value, particularly at the level of broad asset classes such as U.S. stocks. The believed that the prices would revert to fundamental value over time. When the market has an overly optimistic view of future dividend, prices would exceed fair value. Investors would then eventually realize they were too optimistic and that prices would rever toward fair value.Thus at times of high prices GMO would have a contrarian view of expected returns being low.</span> <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> However, our analysis of GMWAX showed that the fund had $\\beta^{\\text{SPY}}$ and correlation to SPY! Thus, GMWAX did not seem very contrarian in its performance.</span> <br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> **Solution:** Harvard places bounds on the portfolio allocation rather than implementing whatever numbers come out of the MV optimization problem along with a long only constraint on non-cash assets. The inequality constraints made this solution easily implementable and computationally easy from a numerical standpoint. However, the many boundary parameters greatly influence the solution making it overparameterized.</span>\n",

    "    \n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> **Solution:**  <span style=\"color:00008B\"> Barnstable proposed that if the assumption of log iid normally distributed returns hold, the mean return of any asset with grow linearly with time. However, the volatility of the asset will grow by a factor of $\\sqrt{\\text{time}}$.Thus according to their proposition the Sharpe ratio of an investment, which is mean return scaled by the volatility, should grow by a factor of $\\sqrt{\\text{time}}$. Thus an investment's sharpe ratio will always be greater for a long-term horizon.</span><br><br>\n",

    "8. <b>  (5pts) Does Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP) imply Covered Interest Parity (CIP)? Or vice-versa? Or neither? Explain.</b><br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> **Solution:** UIP relates expected FX growth to interest rate differential:  </span><br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<center> <span style=\"color:#00008B\">$ln \\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}_{t}[S_{t+1}] - s_{t} = r_{t+1}^{\\text{f,\\$}} - r_{t+1}^{\\text{f,£}} $</span></center> <br>  \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> We can rewrite the UIP condition, using CIP to sub out the interest rate differential for the forward premium.</span><br><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "<center> <span style=\"color:#00008B\">$ln \\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}_{t}[S_{t+1}] - s_{t} = f_{t}^{s} - s_{t}$</span></center> <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> Thus, neither implies the other. CIP is a no-arbitrage relationship of forward rates vs spot rates. UIP is a hypothesis that FX risk does not earn a premium; in other words, expected excess returns of FX are zero. The theory does not imply the no-arbitrage relationship, nor vice-versa. It is true that sometimes we use the CIP relationship to insert into UIP to write it in a different form, but this is not enough to prove UIP; it is simply restating it in terms of forward rates.</span><br><br> \n",

    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> **Solution:**  We found that the VaR ( at 5%) calculated using the approximation based on the normal distribution performed much better as it was able to provide the VaR estimate by frequency of days below the VaR value close to 5%. By definition of VaR, the number returns beyond the estimated VaR (5%) should be occuring with a frequency close to 5%. The notebook from Class Session 3 found that for many assets, the empirical CDF estimate of VaR led to a less accurate \"hit ratio\".</span><br><br>\n",
